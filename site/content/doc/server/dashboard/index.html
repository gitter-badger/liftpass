<h2>Dashboard</h2>

<p>While you can intereact with Liftpass via the API - a more user friendly way is to use the Dashboard. It requires no sophisticated server to run it as it is a standalone web application. It comes as part of the documentation that is built with Liftpass.</p>

<p>For more information on how to build and run the Dashboard can be found in the <a href="/doc/how-to/dashboard/">How To</a> section.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
The Dashboard is great, but should be restricted access either by IP or domain to limit the security vulnerabilities.
</div>
