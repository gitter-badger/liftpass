<h2>Liftpass Server</h2>

<p>Liftpass is broken down in to 3 principle parts:</p>

<p><strong>API server</strong> manages all API requests which includes the calls made by the SDK for updating the application with new prices and transmitting analytics information.</p>

<p><strong>Analytics processing</strong> which processes the analytics information that was sent from the SDK.</p>

<p><strong>The Dashboard</strong> Along with the Liftpass website and documentation that is built as part of the server, the dashboard enables developers to quickly manage application content via the dashboard.</p>

<p>These three components are designed to be modular and easily scalable and reconfigured to fit the size applications that it will serve.</p>
