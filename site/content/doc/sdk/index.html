<h2>SDK</h2>


<p>GondolaCore is an open source mobile pricing management platform. It manages and supplies mobile applications with unique prices and manages analytics from those applications. The mobile applications communicate with GondolaCore using an SDK which is defined below. </p>

<h3>Overview</h3>


<p>The SDK has four primary responsibilities. Namely: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Collecting and managing progress metrics updated by the developer.</li>
	<li>Tracking economy specific activities including purchasing of virtual good and IAP. </li>
	<li>Transmitting the record of progress metrics and economy activity. Receiving of virtual good and IAP prices. </li>
	<li>Supplying to the application prices for every virtual good and IAP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The SDK is fundamentally an event based analytics SDK similar to those of MixPanel, Keen.io, Google Analytics, etc. All data is recorded in form of events which includes event names and associated attributes. However, events are not made accessible directly to the user of the SDK. In fact, to further facilitate use of the SDK strict limitations are imposed on how events are triggered and how much data is associated with the events.</p>

<p>The SDK has two types of triggers that generate events: updates of user progress and purchases of virtual goods and IAP. </p>


<h3>Design Philosophy</h3>

<p>The design of the SDK is based on strict, fixed sized data structures. The progress metrics recorded are referred to by index numbers. To facilitate developers macros will be supplied to the developer so that they do not have to type in mysterious index numbers when updating a metric so instead of updateMetric(12, levelsPlayed) they can type updateMetric(LEVELS_PLAYER, levelsPlayed). In general it will be expected that the SDK is have an additional file supplied by Gondola that facilitates the use of the SDK, containing helper functions and macros. In many ways the SDK specified below should be considered the the foundation for more sophisticated SDKs that can be built on top of. Similar to how C functions are very abstract, and more sophisticated C++ STL is developed on top of.</p>


<h3>Progress Metrics</h3>

<p>Updates of user progress can be considered events with a single attribute. This is the only mechanism of recording both user progress in an application and user profile. Meaning progress is also used to track device type, timezone, OS version and etc.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation Note</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>While updating progress can be seen as an event with a single attribute, when saving the updated progress the event will contain not just the value of the updated metric but also all other tracked progress metrics. </li>
	<li>The SDK supports tracking of 32 progress metrics. 8 are string values and 24 are floating point metrics - stored in an array in that sequence (8 strings followed by 24 numbers).</li>
	<li>The user of the SDK has two primary functions of updating progress: updateProgress(progress index, progress value) and incrementProgress(progress index).</li>
	<li>Certain progress metrics that are hard to be recorded by the SDK user, are automatically filled when other metrics are updated. These include things like time zone, device type, OS version and etc.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Purchase Activity</h3>

<p>When users make a virtual good or IAP purchase, that must be recorded with the SDK using:</p>

{% highlight "c" %}
recordPurchase(good_name, good_price);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This function is used for both virtual goods and IAP purchases interchangeably. When purchasing an IAP, the good price represents the amount of currency the user was rewarded (if any).</p>

<p>Goog price is a structure/array of 8 numbers representing the 8 virtual currencies the SDK supports.</p>


<h3>Data Transfer</h3>


<p>The SDK contains a single REST API call. The call “posts” the data recorded by the SDK and the response is a JSON file containing the price of all virtual goods and the reward for purchasing each IAP.</p>

{% highlight "c" %}
sync() 
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The user of SDK has the ability to choose where in the application the function is called. </p>


<h3>Virtual Good Prices and IAP Rewards</h3>


<p>The SDK manages prices for all goods and IAP. </p>

{% highlight "c" %}
getPrice(good name)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The function returns a structure containing 8 prices representing 8 different currencies. Example is getPrice(“House”) = [100,0,0,50,0,0,0,0]. This represents the fact that a house costs say 100 wood and 50 stone, but also 0 iron, 0 gold, 0 cash, and etc.</p>

<p>Many applications have a single currency or the developer knows the currency the good is priced as. In this case the function below returns a single integer number for the price of the good in the currency specified.</p>

{% highlight "c" %}
getPrice(good name, currency index)
{% endhighlight %}


<h3>SDK Details</h3>

<p>Like all analytics SDKs, when the application loads an initial call initiates the SDK.</p>

{% highlight "c" %}
init(application key)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This initial function creates if necessary all data structures and if required gives the user a unique user ID.</p>


<h3>Data Recording Format</h3>

<p>The data is stored and transmitted to Gondola core in the following JSON format.</p>

<p><strong>General JSON format</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>application: application key used to identify the application. (32 character hex string)</li>
	<li>user: user id. (32 character unique hex string)</li>
	<li>events: list of events in ascending order of timestamp. The last item is the most recent event.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Event JSON format</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>name: event name (32 characters long)</li>
	<li>time: UTC unix timestamp (integer with millisecond precision)</li>
	<li>progress: array containing all 32 progress metrics (first 8 elements must be strings, the others are floating point)</li>
	<li>attributes: optional array containing 16 elements (first 8 elements must be strings, the others are floating point)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Purchase events have event name “purchase”, attributes[0] is the good name, and the 8 floating attribute fields represent the cost of the purchase in virtual currency (for IAP those values represent the reward for the purchase)</li>
	<li>All events must contain all 32 progress metrics</li>
	<li>Attributes are not required when updating a progress metric.</li>
</ul>


<!--Example iOS Usage
-----------------

Initialization of the code goes as follows: 
::

	GondolaCore *gondola = [GondolaCore sharedInstance]

	[gondola setApplicationKey:@"APPLICATION KEY" applicationSecret:@"APPLICATION SECRET"];

	// Debug will print data being sent and recieved by SDK. 
	// Additionally an online dashboard will show activity for applications when run with debug enabled
	[gondola setDebug:YES];

	// The developer can assign the user ID manually. 
	// If none is set, a random UUID is generated. (32 character hex string)
	[gondola setUserID:[GKLocalPlayer localPlayer].playerID];

The SDK will often be implemented in a game that has already been released previously, with existing players. The SDK should allow for the developer to setup current progress metrics on first SDK launch.
::

	if([gondola isFirstTimeLaunch]) {
		[gondola updateStringMetric:6 withValue:@"blue"];
		...
	}

Data is sent to Gondola and prices are retrived with the following simple command.
::

	[gondola sync];

Progress metrics can be updated by the developer using 
::

	[gondola updateStringMetric:6 withValue:@"blue"];
	[gondola updateNumberMetric:14 withValue:sessions];
	[gondola incrementNumberMetric:15];


Obviously these are hard to understand - we will supply developers with a set of Macros to make this easier so that:
::

	GONDOLA_UPDATE_CAR_COLOR(@"blue");
	GONDOLA_UPDATE_TOTAL_SESSIONS(sessions);
	GONDOLA_UPDATE_TOTAL_PLAYS();

	#define GONDOLA_UPDATE_CAR_COLOR(X) \
		([[GondolaCore sharedInstance] updateStringMetric:6 withValue:X])
	#define GONDOLA_UPDATE_TOTAL_SESSIONS(X) \
		([[GondolaCore sharedInstance] updateNumberMetric:14 	withValue:sessions])
	#define GONDOLA_UPDATE_TOTAL_PLAYS() \
		([[GondolaCore sharedInstance] incrementNumberMetric:15])


Developer can get the price of any good using the the following routines
::

	GondolaCoreCurrency *price = [gondola getPrice:@"com.monopoly.boardwalk"];
	float dollarPrice = price.currency1;

Obviously this is hard to understand - we will supply developer with a macro so that
::
	float dollarPrice = GONDOLA_DOLLAR_PRICE(@"com.monopoly.boardwalk");

	#define GONDOLA_DOLLAR_PRICE(@"com.monopoly.boardwalk");

When a player makes a purchase this is how it is logged:
::

	GondolaCoreCurrency *price = [gondola getPrice:@"com.monopoly.boardwalk"];
	[gondola recordVirtualGoodPurchase:@"com.monopoly.boardwalk" withPrice:price];

	GondolaCoreCurrency *reward = [gondola getReward:@"com.monopoly.boardwalk"];
	[gondola recordIAPPurchase:@"com.monopoly.boardwalk" withPrice:0.99 withReward:reward];

Some progress metrics can be tracked by the SDK automatically. Particularly things such as:

* OS
* OS Version
* Language
* Timezone
* Device
* Total Sessions
* Total play time
* Total virtual purchases
* Total iap purchases
* Total dollars spent
* Total currency 1-8 earned
* Total currency 1-8 spent

For these types of "metrics" the developer can allow the SDK to automatically update these metrics. The metric number is not hard coded so they must be defined by the developer when the SDK is initialized.
::
	
	// Metric String #2 will be set automatically to the OS name
	[gondola setStringPipe:GONDOLA_OS toMetric:2];
	// Metric Number #14 will automatically count the session number
	[gondola setNumberPipe:GONDOLA_SESSION_COUNT toMetric:14];
	// Metric Number #15 gets incremented every time a virtual good purchase is made
	[gondola setNumberPipe:GONDOLA_TOTAL_VIRTUAL_PURCHASES toMetric:15];
	// Metric Number #16 gets incremented every time an IAP purchase is made
	[gondola setNumberPipe:GONDOLA_TOTAL_IAP_PURCHASES toMetric:16];
