<h2>Configuring Liftpass for deployment</h2>

<p>The ideal configuration of Liftpass is in conjunction with some kind of outside world facing HTTP server such as NGINX. Additionally Liftpass can be run as a service using Supervisor.</p>

<h3>NGINX Configuration</h3>

<p>The most basic configuration NGINX to work with Liftpass is as follows:</p>

{% highlight 'nginx' %}
server {

        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location / {
                #proxy_pass_header Server;
                proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
                proxy_redirect off;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9090;
        }

}
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Supervisor</h3>

<p>An easy way to bring Liftpass up and down is using it with conjunction with Supervisor. A sample configuration for Supervisor can look like:</p>

<pre><code>[program:liftpass]
command = python3 manage.py API start
directory = /home/ubuntu/liftpass/
</code></pre>
