<h2>Get Started</h2>

<p>You should be able to build Liftpass on most Linux-based systems.</p>

<h3>Get the build dependencies</h3>

<p>Liftpass is developed in Python 3.x. There are a number of modules required for running the server, however all are available through <code>pip</code> and <code>easy_install</code>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Flask</li>
	<li>SQLAlchemy</li>
	<li>Requests</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>setup.py</code> script can install these dependencies on most modern systems that have Python 3.x and SetupTools installed.</p>

<h3>Get the source code</h3>

<p>Download or clone the Liftpass repository:

{% highlight 'bash' %}
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/whiteshoemedia/gondola-core.git
# Download repository as a zip file
wget https://github.com/whiteshoemedia/gondola-core/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Install dependencies</h3>

<p>For most Linux-based systems the <code>setup.py</code> script will install all Python dependencies.

{% highlight 'bash' %}
cd liftpass
python setup.py
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Configuring Liftpass</h3>

<p>Liftpass is configured via the <code>config.py</code> file. This file should have been configured for you while running the <code>setup.py</code> script, but if it didn't you can always re-run: </p>

{% highlight 'bash' %}
python setup.py config
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="alert alert-warning">
	By default Liftpass is configured to use SQLite for all database needs. This is a great solution to evaluate Liftpass in a development environment, but it is not intended for production settings. Liftpass will work with most SQL based databases that SQLAlchemy supports.
</div>


<h3>Starting the server</h3>

<p>You are now ready to manually start running ths server.</p>

{% highlight 'bash' %}
python manage.py API start
{% endhighlight %}
