<h2>Goods</h2>

<p>There are two kinds of goods Liftpass manages:</p>


<p><strong>Virtual Goods</strong> are those that the user buys using virtual currency.</p>
<p><strong>In-App Purchases</strong> are those that are purchased by the user using real money.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Goods must be registered with Liftpass before they can be used in the SDK. The name of the virtual goods should reflect the names as they appear in the code of the application.</p>

<p>Additionally the name of the goods are also used in the pricing sets entered in Liftpass. This is because in all pricing engines the final price the user sees for a good is retrieved from a value-key dictionary where the keys are the names of the goods as they appear in the code.</p>
