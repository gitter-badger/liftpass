<h2>Dynamic Pricing</h2>

<p>Think about how airlines change their fares frequently and offer the same seat on the same flight for anywhere between $100 and $1000 - that's <strong>dynamic pricing</strong>.</p>

<p>The airline tries to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>fill every last seat</li>
	<li>at the highest possible price.</li>
</ol>

<p>Predictive algorithms determine prices based on customer behavior. The outcome is <strong>high prices for all the high spenders and low prices to fill up the remaining seats</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Your freemium game</strong> faces the same challenge. You need a low entry threshold for the highest possible number of players, but you also need to monetize players in an efficient way.</p>

<p>Gondola solves this challenge by introducing <strong>dynamic pricing</strong> for games.</p>
