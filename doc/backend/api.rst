API
===

The primary way to interact with GondolaCore is via the API. Both for editing the content of applications (ex. registingering new applications, modifying goods, uploading new prices) and supplying games with new prices via the GondolaCore SDK. 

All API calls are standarized for interacting with the Backend as well as the SDK. The API follows normal REST best practices where the HTTP request method is as important as the URL itself. All parameters sent are in JSON format as part of the request body.
